# The Story LectureFM
It was a regular day, Jo and I were engaged in a conversation while we were interrupted by the commotion in the class on an upcoming fest called Galaxia. This lecturer said it was an opportunity to prove oneself. We were excited and wanted to play our part and have a project in possibly the electronics stream.
We considered many projects such as a solar panel for efficient power generators, a magic mirror, and of the likes. The students who had developed such concepts were terrific and had developed such practical prototypes, and there was no such area of improvement that we could add value.

We felt if we had to put in the time, let us plan to clock some hours to solve a real problem, and we started to look for such an area of opportunities. 

We have supportive circles in our college, and they tent to record the classes and pass it on to the students who are not present for various reasons where they had to pick different classes at the same time, or not well or participating or volunteering for a program, etc. At times the students who used to record the session may as well be absent, and we missed the class as you can surmise.

This problem was the area of opportunity we wanted to make sure we help develop this concept, and we know it is not a poverty ending idea but still isolates the problem that, if solved, will help our fellow students.

## Preliminaries 
We knew from the start this will not remain a single stream project because it is a real-life scenario we need a pragmatic approach on this project and arrive at a practical solution. Hence, we have an applied electronics project on our hand.

## What does this mean?
We are now not confined to just a PCB circuit, but we need to go ahead and program the possible solution for the same as if we choose to use electronics, we will run into efficiency bottlenecks, and budgets will be adversely affected, and timelines to procure the components would be an ordeal in itself.

## Rasberry of our Project:
We knew that is a tight budget we can not afford to work with much, then we were helped by our senior who had a Pi 3B+ and asked us to direct our efforts in the direction of the project.

A Rasberry-Pi Project to record from bluetooth and upload the audio to a ftp site.
